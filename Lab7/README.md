This repository contains my Lab 7 project for ECEN 122, where I converted a single-cycle/state-machine CPU into a 4-stage pipelined implementation. The lab implements a full instruction decoder (id.v), stages control signals through pipeline registers, defines a NOP instruction to avoid data hazards, and uses HALT to stop instruction fetch. I then wrote and simulated a straight-line test program with inserted NOPs, verified correct register and memory behavior via waveforms, and discussed how data forwarding hardware could further reduce the need for NOPs.
