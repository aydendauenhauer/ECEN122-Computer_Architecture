This repository contains my Lab 5 project for ECEN 122, where I completed the Verilog implementation of a simple processor with load, store, arithmetic, immediate, display, and halt instructions. The lab wires together the PC, data memory, register file, ALU, sign-extension unit, address and data multiplexers, and an extended control state machine, then uses a testbench program to load values from memory, perform adds/subtracts, store results, and verify correct operation via simulation waveforms.
