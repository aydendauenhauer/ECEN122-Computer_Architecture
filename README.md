# ECEN122-Computer_Architecture
This repository contains my ECEN 122 – Computer Architecture lab projects, implemented in C, assembly, and hardware description languages at Santa Clara University. The goal of these labs is to practice core computer architecture concepts, including instruction set design, datapath and control, pipelining, memory hierarchies (caches and main memory), and performance analysis. The repository includes source files for the lab implementations as well as any helper modules, header files, and supporting documentation. This project is shared for personal reference and portfolio purposes only. If you are currently enrolled in ECEN 122, please do not copy this work or submit it as your own. Follow SCU’s academic integrity policies.
