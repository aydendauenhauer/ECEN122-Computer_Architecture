ECEN 122 – Computer Architecture lab projects, implemented in C, assembly, and hardware description languages. The goal of these labs is to practice core computer architecture concepts, including instruction set design, datapath and control, pipelining, memory hierarchies (caches and main memory), and performance analysis.
