This repository contains my Lab 4 project for ECEN 122, where I implemented the Verilog control state machine (l4_SM) for a simple processor datapath. The lab defines FETCH, DECODE, LOAD, READ_X/READ_Y, ADD, SUB, MV, ADDI, SUBI, DISP, and HALT states, drives the register file, ALU, program counter, and display control signals, and verifies correct instruction sequencing and halt behavior using simulation waveforms and a post-lab report.
