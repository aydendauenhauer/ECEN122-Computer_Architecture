This repository contains my Lab 1 project for ECEN 122, where I designed a Verilog finite state machine for a three-bit counter and created a testbench to simulate its behavior. The lab implements both a direction-controlled up/down counter and a start/done–controlled counter with reset and clock inputs, then verifies the state transitions and output count using waveform simulations.
