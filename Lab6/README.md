This repository contains my Lab 6 project for ECEN 122, where I extended the Verilog control state machine and datapath to support branch-on-zero (bz) and branch-on-nonzero (bnz) instructions. The lab implements new FSM states and control signals, a branch condition module, and a branch PC adder to compute signed branch targets, then tests a loop program in mem.txt to verify correct branching behavior.
